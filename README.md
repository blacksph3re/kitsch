# Kitsch kooking app

This is a unification of two cooking apps, done by Anja, Hendrik and Nico. The purpose is to accomodate a recipe recommendation algorithm and the price planning functionality of alastair in one, multi-functional cooking app.



It consists of several repositories, thus when cloning use the recursive flag.

* **[Loginservice](github.com/blacksph3re/loginservice)** Handling sign-on, login and basic user-related matters
* **[Alastair](github.com/blacksph3re/alastair2)** A recipe db originally designed to facilitate price calculations for event-cooking
* **Anja's part** Generating recommendations based on a set of input ingredients
* **Frontend** A frontend for all of the above written in Vue.js
* **[Kitsch](github.com/blacksph3re/kitsch)** A repo uniting all of the above, managing orchestration and deployment
